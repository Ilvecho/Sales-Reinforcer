The goals of this project, carried out with the sales team of a Technology company in the Education industry, are to understand the underlying patterns in CRM data, and to optimize the user acquisition pipeline to improve the companyâ€™s sales funnel with the ultimate goal to create the best user experience for customers worldwide.
- Designed a Reinforcement Learning agent that optimizes the user acquisition pipeline to evenutally discover the optimal attributes and actions to increase overall sales.
- Data pre-processing and extensive Exploratory Data Analysis, focused on the distributions of categorical features and the chronological order of datetime features
- Modeled the state space as the union of the different encodings (mainly one-hot, but also boolean and integer) of the features
- Defined the action space and identified their transition probabilities
- Assigned the rewards to the target states and to intermediate secondary targets
- Implemented a Q-learning algorithm with state-based Q function modeled with a multi-layer Neural Network (Deep Q-Learning)
- Created the training loop with epsilon greedy action selection and fixed Q-target
- Implemented a Prioritized Replay Buffer with priority inversely proportional to the experience transition probability to solve the issue of low probabilities of the target state paths
- With the optimal policy obtained in the training, simulated 50'000 episodes to infer the best attributes and onboarding pipeline
- The optimal onboarding pipeline alone increased the probability of success of the first contact by 236% and of the subscription by 316%
- The optimal onboarding pipeline combined with the identified best candidates selection, increased the probability of success of the first contact by 571% and of the subscription by 864%
